Syntax is the set of rules that describes how the code is to be interpreted, or compiled, which in turns sets requirements for how it must be written by the programmer.

                <p class="content_text">Computers are hardware that can be used for multiple purposes and the way to do different things is to write sequences of steps called programs. The computer can execute these different programs, and each program is written in different languages. The idea of a computer program is an abstracted concept that can refer to different types of things.</p>

                    <p class="list_stem">Examples of different types of programs:</p>

              <p class="content_text">An interepreted language is one in which the processor "runs" the code as it is encountered. This is a little different from a compiled language in which a program is "compiled" ahead of time by a compiler. The compiler is a computer program that "translates" a code written by the programmer into a far more basic code that is closer to the computer's natural capabilities.</p>

                <p class="content_text">The first part of this stage of the course goes into the basic rules that surround computer languages, and compares computer languages to natural languages like English, Latin, Greek, Spanish, etc.</p>
               
                <p class="topic_subheader">Commands</p>
                <p class="content_text">A command is an instruction that uses a convention of the programming language. The example in the tutorial is the command &quot;Print,&quot; which is a Python command that means &quot;return the results of the following.&quot; The programmer then follows the command with operational language that the command can execute.</p>
              <p class="topic_subheader">Language Ambiguity</p>
                <p class="content_text">Natural languages contain ambiguous meanings that humans can interepret in several different ways, and then decide which meaning would be most applicable to the logical flow of thought in the communication. In this way we can make a pretty solid guess about what a speaker probably means, and often be correct in that guess.</p>
                <p class="topic_subheader">Forms of Grammar Notations</p>
                <p class="content_text">Backus-Naur Form (BNF) is one example of a formal notation system for explaining the rules of a language. It can be used to describe the language rules of both natural languages and computer languages. BNF classifies the elements of a language into Non-terminal and terminal elements, and specifies where replacements can be used. It also defines the structure of an acceptable statement in the language. By placing the language elements into their proper placements as specified in the rule, sentences are formed by the author.</p>
                
                <p class="content_text">Computer languages need to eliminate ambiguity. Commands and other phrases in a computer language need to have one and only one meaning. Computers are not sophisticated enough to take guesses at what programmers intend, or hope the results will be.</p>
                <p class="content_text">In Python an acceptable statement is refered to as an expression.</p>

            <span class="topic_header">Debugging Strategies and Techniques</span>
            <p class="content_text">Debugging refers to finding and removing errors in the program. Developing a system for doing this is key to successful programming.</p>
            <p class="topic_subheader">The Traceback Statement</p>
            <p class="content_text">As a strategy, review the error messages the code gives you. <span class = "attention">Tracebacks</span> are error messages that give the programmer an idea of where the program stopped working in its execution. It also gives an error type. The message that shows the error type can then be used in searches to find solutions.</p>
             <p class="topic_subheader">The Comment</p>
             <p class="content_text">As a strategy, limit the amount of code you need to focus on to find the error. Using comments in your code can temporarily extract troublesome sections of code as a way of locating exactly where the error is. Use the <span class = "attention">#</span> to create a comment line so that the interpreter ignores that line of code in your program. "Comment off" sections of suspected buggy code until you "trap the bug."</p>
             <p class="topic_subheader">Borrowed or Sample Code</p>
             <p class="content_text">As a strategy, let others guide your way. Use code provided by other coders in your own. They've already done a lot of wor. Just ensure that their code works as you intend for it to, and ensure that it does what they say it will do.</p>
            <p class="topic_subheader">The Print Statement</p>
            <p class="content_text">As a strategy, find the spots where the code isn't performing as you expect. Using the print statement is a way of manually creating a trace within your program. Tracing a program is a way of finding out which lines of code work ok, and exactly where the code breaks. So if line 100 works fine, and line 102 has a problem in it, then print statements on either side of line 102 can help you locate the trouble.</p>
            <p class="topic_subheader">Version Control</p>
            <p class="content_text">As a strategy, compare newer versions of code to older versions known to work as intended. Save your code, and refer to older versions of it later. Comparing newer code to older code is a good way of falling back to known good versions of code if you get out too far onto a limb.</p>

           <p class="topic_subheader">Lists</p>
            <p class="content_text">A list is similar to a string, in that it contains a series of different elements. However it is a little different in that it can contain more than just characters.</p>
            <div class="list">
              <p class="list_stem">Lists can contain:</p>

              <p class="topic_subheader">Mutating Lists</p>
            <p class="content_text">You can change the contents of a list, or mutate the list. Access the item in the list you want to change, and use the assignment operator to reassign that element of the list to the new value you want. This action actually changes the contents of the list, which is different from a string. with a string you cannot reassign the values of the individual positions in the string, it just isn't supported. With lists, it is. The example below would change (mutate) the list to remove <span class="attention">Larry</span> and place <span class="attention">Shemp</span> in its place:</p>
            <p class="content_text">Example:</p>
            <p class="code_sample">stooges = &#91 &#39Moe&#39,  &#39Larry&#39, &#39Curly&#39&#93</p>
            <p class="code_sample">stooges = &#912&#93 = &#39Shemp&#39</p>
            <p class="topic_subheader">Aliases</p>
            <p class="content_text">Two different references to the same object. They use the example of James Bond and 007 are both references to the same person. Whatever state the object has affects both references. So the bad guys take away the martini, then both James Bond and 007 are affected by that. Two variable names that refer to the same object, if you change the vaul of that object, then either variable is going to see the changed state.  </p>
            <p class="content_text">Example:</p>
            <p class="code_sample">Bond = &#91 &#39J&#39,  &#39a&#39, &#39m&#39, &#39e&#39, &#39s&#39,&#93</p>
            <p class="code_sample">007 = Bond</p>
            <p class="content_text">Both of the two variables, <span class = "attention">Bond</span> and <span class = "attention">007</span> refer to the same object, a list of letters that make up our hero's first name. To mutate either of these is to mutate the other as well.</p>
           <p class="topic_subheader">Appending Lists</p>
            <p class="content_text">This is a method (which is like a function that's built into the language). It will add an element onto the end of something, and we'll use to mutate a list. This does NOT create a new list, but rather mutates the existing list, giving it a new element on the end. One element you can add is another list, but when append list 02 onto list 01, list 02 gets inserted <span class="attention">as a list</span>, i.e. list 02 becomes a single new element within list 01.</p>
           <p class="content_text">Syntax Example:</p>
            <p class="code_sample">&#60 list 01 &#62.append(&#60 element &#62)</p>
            <p class="code_sample">stooges = &#91 &#39Moe&#39,  &#39Larry&#39, &#39Curly&#39&#93</p>
            <p class="code_sample">stooges.append('Shemp') --&gt; stooges = &#91 &#39Moe&#39,  &#39Larry&#39, &#39Curly&#39 , &#39Shemp&#39&#93 </p> 
            
            <p class="topic_subheader">+</p>
            <p class="content_text">This is another method (which is like a function that's built into the language). It is similar to the method that concatenates strings. It does NOT mutate lists, just puts them together in output.  </p>
            <p class="content_text">Syntax Example:</p>
            <p class="code_sample">&#60 list 01 &#62 + &#60 list 02 &#62</p>
            <p class="code_sample">&#91 0 ,   1&#93 + &#91 2 , 3&#93 --&gt; This will print out &#91 0 ,   1, 2 , 3&#93</p>, but list 01 has not been altered in memory. So any subsequent print of list 01 will show it as it was before the + operator.
            <p class="topic_subheader">Extend</p>
            <p class="content_text">This is another method (which is like a function that's built into the language). This extends the list, and adds new stuff into the new slots in the list. This is different from appending a list onto a list (see above). In this case, each element within list 02 becomes a seperate, and new element in list 01.</p>
           <p class="content_text">Syntax Example:</p>
            <p class="code_sample">&#60 list 01 &#62 += &#60 list 02 &#62<span class = "attention"> --> will return longer list 01, with new items in that list. What new items? The items contained in list 02.</span>.</p>
            <p class="topic_subheader">len</p>
            <p class="content_text">This is another method (which is like a function that's built into the language). It works on lots of things, not just lists. It takes an object that is a collection of thing, and it outputs the number of things (length) in the object. </p>
           <p class="content_text">Syntax Example:</p>
            <p class="code_sample">len &#40&#60 list &#62&#41</p>
            <p class="code_sample">len &#40&#91 0 &#93,  &#91 1 &#93 &#41--> <span class = "attention">will return a 2, because there are two items in that list</span>.</p>
            <p class="topic_subheader">Index</p>
            <p class="content_text"><span class = "note">Note:</span><span class = "attention">The index method occurs at the end of the presentation on For loops, which occurs just after Appending, +, and len. I'm placing these notes here because I want them consolidated in my notes.</span> 
           <p class="content_text">This is another method which takes in a list and a value, then returns the first position in the list where that vaule exists. It returns an error if it does not find the value. But it isn't a &quot;total-crap-out&quot; error, it's more of a  statement that says that it did not find the value in the list.  </p>
           <p class="content_text">Syntax Example:</p>
            <p class="code_sample">list.index &#40&#60 value &#62&#41 </p>
            <p class="code_sample">&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="topic_subheader">In (and its opposite: not in)</p>
           <p class="content_text"><span class = "note">Note:</span><span class = "attention">The in method occurs at the end of the presentation on For loops, which occures just after Appending, +, len, and Index. I'm placing these notes here because I want them consolidated in my notes.</span> 
            <p class="content_text">In is another method. It takes in a value and returns <span class = "attention">True</span> if it finds that value in the list. It returns <span class = "attention">False</span> if it does not find the value. </p>
            <p class="content_text">It corresponds to <span class = "attention">not in</span>, which does the opposite. If the value is not in the list, then the method returns <span class = "attention">True</span>. If the value is found in the list then it returns <span class = "attention">False</span>.</p>
           <p class="content_text">Syntax Example (in):</p>

                <p class="content_text">The first part of ...</p>
               
                <p class="topic_subheader">The Take a Break Program</p>
                <p class="content_text">The program for taking a break is presented as popping up a video in a browser every 2 hours or so to remind the user to &quot;take a break.&quot; To do this, Kunal writes a simple program that waits for an amount of time (we're going for two hours, but we'll test it using time periods of only a few seconds at a time), then opens a browser and plays a video embedded on youtube.</p>
                <p class="topic_subheader">Libraries</p>
                
                <p class="content_text">Kunal uses two functions in Python's &quot;library&quot; of functionality. This <span class = "attention">library</span> includes lots of functions that we did not write, but we can call upon and use. A library of preexisting code can be downloaded and imported for our own use. Importantly, we don't really know how the functions work, because the details of their functionality are hidden from us.</p>
              <p class="topic_subheader">Abstraction</p>
                <p class="content_text">The "hiding of details" is an example of <span class = "attention">abstraction</span>. Abstraction is an advantage because, with it, we don't need to focus on anything except the code we want to produce and use. Abstraction removes the minor elements and is really only the high level information about a section of code.</p>
                <p class="topic_subheader">Exceptions</p>
                <p class="content_text">The <span class = "attention">exception</span> happens when a program cannot handle the situation it is working on. In the example, Kunal asks what would happen if the renaming program cannot find the file (and we've already seen that when the files were in a different folder), or when it would try to rename a file to a name that would already exist. The program isn't sophisticated enough to check for either of these in advance or make a decision about what to do in either case, so it would just throw an error and quit running.</p>

                <span class="topic_header">Using Classes</span>
                <p class="content_text">Kunal uses the <span class = "attention">turtle</span> function from the Python library to create a square on a red screen. This is his way of introducing the concept of classes in programming. Kunal calls the <span class = "attention">turtle</span> function and gives it sets of commands that it eventually uses to draw, first a square, then a circle.</p>
                <p class="topic_subheader">Classes</p>
                <p class="content_text">Kunal needs to draw more than one kind of shape, but we don't want to program differently for every shape. We need code that can be used as a basic blueprint, and then be modified slightly as needed for variations. in the example <span class = "attention">turtle</span> is the class. It contains key information, but it can have different <span class = "attention">instances</span> of the blueprint.</p>
                 <p class="content_text">Another analogy to explain classes is that it is like template. A template can be downloaded and used to create a major element of a design, but it can be modified or varied, so that multiple things can be created from the same template.</p>
                 <p class="content_text">Yet another is the CSS version of a <span class = "attention">class</span>, which is acutally called a class. Multiple elements on an HTML page can be within that class, but those elements are different instances of it.</p>
                 <p class="content_text">The class contains information about what it can do.</p>

                <p class="content_text">While the <span class = "attention">class</span> is a general designation, the <span class = "attention">instance</span>is more specific. Once the class is created, we can call on it over and over again by creating different instances in our code. Each instance makes use of the code already created rather than recreating the same code over again each time we need a variation on the task to be completed. Instead, we create an instance for each variation.</p>
                <p class="topic_subheader">Calling the Function inside the Class</p>
                <p class="content_text">The class contains code within it that sets aside computer memory for the function. When we call the turtle class, we are <span class = "attention">using the function that is in it.</span> rather than just calling a function directly.</p>
                <p class="code_sample">import &#60filename&#62 </p>
                <p class="content_text">We can then use the code inside our program to dive into that class, and create or<span class = "attention">initialize</span> space in memory for an instance of that class.</p>
                <p class="content_text">For example:</p>
                <p class="code_sample">&#60variable name&#62 = &#60path&#62 . &#60class&#62 </p>
                <p class="content_text">What that does is create space in memory (named for our variable name) that creates an instance of the class, which resides down in that path.</p>

                 <p class="content_text">The term <span class = "attention">init</span> is a reserved word within Python. To create the init function the following syntax is used:</p>

                <p class="content_text">The term <span class = "attention">instance variable</span> is a variable that is specific to the instance of the class, although it may have the same name as a corresponding variable in a differernt instance. That is to say, an instance variable is <span class = "attention">NOT</span> a global variable. However, the leading prefix <span class = "attention">self</span> keeps it from being a simple local variable. Since the prefix <span class = "attention">self</span> is there, the variable can be referenced from outside the class.</p>

              <ul>
                <li>Class Variables - Variables that we want all instances to share, these are defined at the class level.</li>
                <li>Preexisting Class Variables - This is a prepackaged variable that comes baked into the Python classes. </li>
              </ul>
              </div>
            <p class="topic_subheader">Class Variables</p>
            <p class="content_text">These exist at the level of the class, and are outside the domain of any one instance, so it is different from an instance variable. Kunal uses the example of movie ratings to demonstrate an example of a class rating. All instances can use this variable because it is common to any instance. The Google style guide recommends defining class variables in all caps.</p>
            <p class="topic_subheader">Preexisting Class Variables</p>
            <p class="content_text">These are class variables that are predefined in Python, so you don't have to create them yourself. Examples given are <span class = "attention">__doc__</span>, <span class = "attention">__name__</span>, and <span class = "attention">__module__</span>.</p>
            <p class="topic_subheader">Inheritance</p>
            <p class="content_text">Inheritance allows the reuse of existing code, which is a key idea in OOP since it allows more efficient coding and time conservation. Kunal uses and example set of code involving variables named for Billy Ray and Miley Cyrus to demonstrate how the child and parent relationship works in computer science. The child reuses the code from the parent. Kunal also describes how the use of inheritance allows programmers to map the associations that exist in our brain, such as television shows and movies which are both subcategories of video.</p>
            <p class="topic_subheader">Methods</p>
            <p class="content_text">A method is like a routine, a function, or a functional portion of a program.</p>
